## All Aboard The Hype Train

I recently watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IACHfKmZMr8){target="_blank"} from Y Combinator, and to be honest, I could barely finish without my eyes rolling right out of my head. It feels like the essence of the AI hype bubble. Of every tech hype bubble, really; pump-and-dump startups trying to con venture capitalists into bestowing just one more series of funding. This time though, the ice cream sundae comes topped with the additional promise of being able to fire 90% of your workforce.

I try to avoid hype in all aspects of my life; I've never pre-ordered a video game, my side projects use technology that I'm most comfortable with, and I recently researched a $40 purchase for weeks before deciding to order it. My wife says I need to work on expressing myself when I actually am excited for something. I'm not a particularly experienced or old software engineer, but with the breakneck pace this industry moves, even I have lived through multiple tech hype cycles. I believe that eventually, AI progress will reach a local maxima and the hype will settle down a bit.

You might argue that I'm begging the question and assuming that excitement about AI is unwarranted and is therefore hype. This is a fair complaint, but I don't actually think that the excitement is entirely unwarranted. It's an incredible technology! I use it practically every day! People should be excited about AI! But as I keep having to tell my friends and family, I don't believe my career and livelihood is threatened by it. Quite the opposite, actually.

## My Own Junior Engineer

I like to think of an LLM as a junior engineer. I ask it to do a task, it gives me an answer that looks correct, and then I double check it and fix it when it isn't. It can save you a lot of time on repetitive tasks and boilerplate, and it can even act as a [rubber duck](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-rubber-duck-method){target="_blank"} to bounce ideas off of. This is a really convenient use case, but I still need to know how to code in order to evaluate the work it produces.

The video I mentioned at the beginning of this post promotes "vibe coding", which seems to be the strategy of giving the LLM no moderation at all, other than asking it to add a feature or fix a bug. This is not the relationship of a senior engineer to a junior engineer. This is the relationship of a project manager to a senior engineer, and we've already established that LLMs are not at the level of senior engineers. This is a recipe for [disaster](https://old.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1jg39g2/looks_like_vibe_coding_failed_him/){target="_blank"}, and I hope that no company actually decides to try this method of engineering, but who am I kidding.

## AI Is Good, Actually

Now, I love having my own personal junior engineer, and I'd like to make a more optimistic prediction about the impact of AI. I believe that LLMs do make developers more productive, but this will only cause tech companies to be able to get more done with their existing resources. Why lay off engineers and choose to reduce productivity to save on payroll? If you really need to cut payroll costs, you fire people regardless of productivity. This is not the prediction I mentioned, however.

By making individual engineers more productive, AI lowers the cost of entry for new startups and companies. This is a really good thing. Usually you can't afford any employees in the early stages of a company unless you have a lot of cash to burn. This causes most startups to seek investment, and then we end up with the venture capital fueled nightmare we live in today.

Personally, I think it's much healthier for companies to make a profit and deliver actual value to people from the moment of their inception. With LLMs, a tech-savvy founder and one or two AI assistants can build an MVP at a fraction of the cost; no need to constantly chase investors to extend the runway. More healthy businesses mean more healthy competition which leads to better products at better prices. Everyone wins. I'm currently attempting to leverage AI like this in developing my own side projects. I'm not building wrappers around ChatGPT; I'm using it to speed up development on real web apps, and I'll share my results once the experiment plays out.
